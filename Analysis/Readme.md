# Analysis Folder

This folder contains the analysis scripts, organized code, and results from simulations conducted for the study on banking system resilience. The analysis explores various network structures, effects of central bank interventions, and the systemic risk associated with interbank dependencies through a series of dynamic simulations.

## Folder Structure

- **`Readme.md`**: Overview of the Analysis Folder and its contents.
- **`Code_Network`**: Contains Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files that execute simulation models and perform data analysis.
  - The notebook is organized by specific tasks, including:
    - Simulation Setup and Configuration
    - Execution of Dynamic Banking System Simulations
- **`Results Folder`**: Stores all figures and visualizations generated from the simulations.
  - **Figures**: Illustrations of key findings figures.


## Analysis Overview

The simulations conducted within these notebooks address the following research questions:
1. **Systemic Risk and Network Resilience**: How do different interbank network structures influence the stability and resilience of the banking system?
2. **Impact of Central Bank Interventions**: What role do central bank interventions play in stabilizing the system, and how do these interventions influence interbank dependency?

## Usage

1. **Run Simulations**: Open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially to replicate the simulations.
2. **Explore Results**: Review the `Results` folder for visual summaries of the key findings. Figures are labeled based on the specific simulation scenario they represent.

## Requirements

- **Jupyter Notebook** for running simulations
- **Simulation Dependencies**: Ensure necessary simulation packages or functions are available (e.g., custom libraries for specific models if applicable).
